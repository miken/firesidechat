                <p>Textpert<br>Co-Founder & CMO</p>
                <p class="bio">
                    At 27, I felt lost. At times I loved my career in advertising, and at times I felt bored and unchallenged. So I did what any confused yet successful 27-year old does – I got my MBA. Two years and twenty theme-parties later, I still didn’t know what I wanted to be when I grew up. I was deciding between going back to work at a well-known tech company, or risking it all and doing something completely different. I decided I was sick of all of the free organic green smoothies and free dry cleaning and free societal pats-on-the-back those big companies were offering, and take a risk. Prior to founding Textpert, Kate worked in marketing at companies such as Facebook, Johnson & Johnson, and P&G. She also has a BA from Brown University and an MBA from UCLA Anderson.
